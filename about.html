                        <p>Edify Academy began in 2024 with a mission to help schools find quality supply teachers. We quickly recognised the need for comprehensive educational support and evolved our services to meet the changing needs of students and schools.</p>
                        <p>In 2025, we expanded to supplying tutors directly to students, helping them access online tuition and personalised learning support. Today, we're proud to offer both online and in-person tutoring services, helping students across the UK achieve their academic goals.</p>
                        <p>Our new in-person tutoring centre opening in 2026 represents the next chapter in our journey, providing students with a dedicated space for focused learning and academic growth.</p>
